Task -> 1 
Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

I have created a number guessing game with 3 levels using random number generator 
A number will generated randomly according levels and range of number.
1st level will let the player to guess between 1-30 numbers with 10 attempts to guess.
2nd level will let the player to guess between 1-50 numbers with 10 attempts to guess.
3rd level will let the player to guess between 1-100 numbers with 10 attempts to guess.
Each level has separate attempt counter if a player can't guess in 10 attempts then game will be over and
player gets a message of game over or play again. similar for 3 levels.
A player will promote to next level if guessed correctly in present level. 3rd level is the final level.
